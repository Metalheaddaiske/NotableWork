This is a simple webpage I created in my spare time for the purpose of learning
HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I just filled areas for text with jokes and quotes
from the movie Monty Python: The Holy Grail because the movie is popular with 
computer nerds. Its not really intricate or flashy, but it was enough for me to 
learn the basics of these three languages. All of the files that come with this 
package must remain in the same directory for the webpage to work. 

USE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download the entire "Camelot Webpage" folder and ensure that its contents stay in the 
same directory. To start up the webpage, open the .html file entitled "camelot.html" 
using any browser of choice. 

The "Nothing to See Here" button opens a drop down menu 
that does not actually do anything or link to anything else. It only exists as coding
practice because I was learning how to code a drop down menu in HTML and JavaScript. 
Click the button again to close the menu.

The "Fizzy Soda" button links to a webpage displaying the output of a simple JavaScript
program that prints the numbers 1 through 100, replacing multiples of three with "Fizz"
and multiples of five with "Buzz". 

The "Computers" button changes the button text to "Not Computers" when clicked. This
served as a means of learning how to implement stylistic changes.

The "This Button is Right Out" button links to another webpage conatining just some text.
This button simply existed so that I could practice linking to other pages. 

Note that, if you open the "camelot.html" file in a web browser
and click one of the links, the "back" button in the browser will not work. Thus,
the browser will have to be closed and "camelot.html" will have to be reopened for
use of the webpage to be continued.
