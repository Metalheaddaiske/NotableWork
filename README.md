# NotableWork
This repository is a compilation of notable projects I have done for university coursework, personal interest,
and self study. 

However, not every notable project I have done will be included here. Some porjects I have done for university classes
have used material that was provided by an instructor or a third party, and, thus, I am not permitted to upload them
due to copyright concerns. 

Feel free to download, check out, and run any of the files in this repository. Instructions for use will be included with all
projects.
